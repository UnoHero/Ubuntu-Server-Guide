                <h4>Creating Your VM:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Virtual Machine is like a computer within a computer. It's a pretend computer that runs on your real computer. This pretend computer can have its own operating system and software, just like a real one. People use VMs to do different tasks on the same computer without them getting in each other's way. It's like having multiple computers in one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Locate your class's name and Elev-Pool within VMWare vCenter. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Right-click on your Elev-Pool and choose "New Virtual Machine."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide a name for your VM and proceed through the setup steps, ensuring it's in the right Elev-Pool and on the correct version.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Select Ubuntu (64-bit) as the operating system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An operating system is like the boss of your computer. It tells your computer what to do and how to do it. It manages all the programs and files, and it helps you interact with your computer, like clicking on icons and opening apps. Without an operating system, your computer wouldn't know how to work.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <br>
                <h4>Configuring VM Settings:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Adjust the VM's resources, such as RAM (Random Accses Memory) you can set it to 8GB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Configure the "Hard Disk" settings to use "Thin Provision". Thin Provisioning is like a flexible storage plan for your computer. Instead of reserving a lot of space upfront, it only uses what you need. It's like saying you have a big backpack, but you only put stuff in it when you actually need it. This helps save space and makes your computer more efficient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Set the "New CD/DVD Drive" to "Content Library ISO File" and choose "ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64."
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <br>
                <h4>Installing Ubuntu Server:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Launch the web console and select "Try and install Ubuntu Server."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Choose your preferred language and keyboard layout.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When prompted, edit the IPv4 settings, changing from "automatic (DHCP)" to "Manual."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In simple terms, DHCP is a system that assigns unique addresses to your devices on a network, making it easier for them to connect to the internet without you having to set up each device individually. It's like a party host arranging seats for guests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fill in the Subnet, Address, Gateway, and NameServer details as required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Think of a subnet as a neighborhood in a city. It's a group of connected devices or computers that can easily talk to each other because they are in the same 'neighborhood.' It helps organize and manage devices on a network.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An address is like your home address but for a computer on a network. It's a unique set of numbers that tells other devices where to find or send data. It's like a computer's location on the internet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A gateway is like the main entrance to a neighborhood. It's the connection point between your local network and the outside internet. It directs data in and out, acting as the 'door' for your network to communicate with the broader internet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A NameServer is like a phone book for the internet. It translates easy-to-remember names (like website URLs) into IP addresses, which computers understand. It helps your computer find the right location on the internet when you type a web address.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <br>
                <h4>Final Steps:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "Update to the new Installer."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use the entire disk and complete the installation by entering your name, desired username, and password.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not select Ubuntu Pro, you can install SSH for GitHub if you want.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Restart the server after installation, press Enter to remove the installation medium, and log in when it's ready.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Result:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Congratulations! You now have an up and running Ubuntu VM.

                    <li>
                        Sudo is like a special command that gives you superpowers on your computer. It stands for 'Superuser Do' and lets you do important things, like making big changes or installing software, that regular users can't.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Apt is a tool that helps you find and install software on your computer, acting like a helpful robot that makes software management simple.

                    Once Apache2 is installed, you can open your preferred web browser and search for your server's IP address. You should then see the default Apache2 site.

                    You can use the HTTPS link, it wont require a key so it can be faster/easyer but if it's a site that is going to be changed and uppdated a lot ssh is better.

            <h4>Setting Up Your Server:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    In the server's terminal, navigate to /var/www/ but refrain from entering the html folder as it will be removed later. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Attempt to clone the repository by running "sudo git clone (the copied link)." This wil download the files from github.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you encounter an error, it's likely due to a missing SSH key.
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <h4>Generating an SSH Key:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    To generate an SSH key, go to the root directory and then to ".ssh." Start by running "sudo -i" to log in as the root user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the "/root/.ssh" directory, use the command "ssh-keygen" and press Enter for each question.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Confirm if it worked by running "ls." If you see a file named "id_rsa.pub," you've done it correctly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Print the key to the terminal by running "cat id_rsa.pub." Copy everything from "ssh-rsa" to "@test."
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <br>
            <h4>Adding the SSH Key to GitHub:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Open your GitHub settings, locate the SSH key section, and click "create a new key."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Paste the key into the large box and assign it a name. Save it, and then reopen the terminal.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h4>Final Steps:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Type "exit" to exit from the root user. Ensure you're in the /var/www/ directory, not /var/www/html.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Try cloning the repository again using "sudo git clone (the GitHub SSH link you copied)." If successful, it will begin downloading, and you'll see it if you run "ls."  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Apache2 searches for the "html" folder, so we must remove the existing one and rename the GitHub folder. Execute "sudo rm -r html" to delete the html folder and its contents.     
                </li>
                <li>
                    To ensure Apache2 finds your site, rename the downloaded folder to "html" using "sudo mv /var/www/(Name of the folder) /var/www/html."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Confirm that your main HTML file is named "index.html," or Apache2 won't locate it. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Now, try visiting your website using the IP address, and your website should appear.              
                </li>
            </ul>
